#######My experience so far at code plateau

I've come to believe in the language of the universe. how events allign to make certain things a reality. early this year, it was my desire to learn web development and when  cam down to plateau, i had made upmy mind to learn this myself, despite the fact that i knew it would be challenging, but it was the only choice since i couldn't afford paying somewhere to be taught. Then BOOM! code plateau came  up and i knew this was the opportunity and i had to grab it.

so far the classes have been exciting, i've learnt so much in just two weeks, the excitment at the imagination of what  stand to gain at the of this month can only be realised only if one delves into my mind. 

Awesome is the word.
